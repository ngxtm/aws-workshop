During my internship at **First Cloud Journey (FCJ)** from **September 6, 2025** to **December 24, 2025**, I had the opportunity to dive deep into AWS cloud services, work on a real team project, and experience how things work in a professional environment.

### What I Did

The internship covered two main tracks running in parallel:

**AWS Learning Path:**
- Completed 6 AWS Modules covering fundamentals, networking, compute, storage, security, and database services
- Practiced 33 hands-on labs from basic EC2 setup to advanced topics like CDK, SageMaker, and CloudWatch
- Attended 5 AWS events including Vietnam Cloud Day, GenAI Builder Club, and Well-Architected Security workshop

**Team Project (MapVibe):**
- Worked with a team of 5 to build a restaurant search application
- Handled database design with PostgreSQL + PostGIS + pgvector
- Developed a hybrid search engine combining BM25 text search with semantic vector search
- Built a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for natural language queries
- Migrated the entire stack to AWS using Terraform

Through this experience, I improved my skills in cloud architecture, Infrastructure as Code, serverless development, and working as part of a team on a real project with deadlines and deliverables.

### Self-Evaluation

Looking back at these 3+ months, here's my honest assessment across different areas:

| No. | Criteria | Description | Good | Fair | Average |
|-----|----------|-------------|------|------|---------|
| 1 | **Professional knowledge & skills** | Understanding AWS services, applying knowledge in practice, proficiency with tools, work quality | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 2 | **Ability to learn** | Absorbing new knowledge quickly - from basic VPC to RAG systems in 12 weeks | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 3 | **Proactiveness** | Taking initiative, researching solutions, not waiting to be told what to do | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 4 | **Sense of responsibility** | Completing assigned tasks on time, owning my part of the project | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 5 | **Discipline** | Adhering to schedules, following processes | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 6 | **Progressive mindset** | Accepting feedback, willing to redo work when needed | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 7 | **Communication** | Presenting ideas clearly, reporting progress to team | ☐ | ✅ | ☐ |
| 8 | **Teamwork** | Collaborating with team members, helping others when stuck | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 9 | **Professional conduct** | Respecting colleagues, maintaining good relationships | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 10 | **Problem-solving skills** | Debugging issues, finding solutions when things don't work | ☐ | ✅ | ☐ |
| 11 | **Contribution to project/team** | Delivering working features, bringing ideas to the table | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 12 | **Overall** | General evaluation of the entire internship period | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |

### Why These Ratings

**Professional knowledge (Good):** Completed 33 labs and applied that knowledge to build a working search system. The transition from "what is VPC" to "deploying a RAG system with Terraform" shows real progress.

**Learning ability (Good):** Picked up new technologies quickly - pgvector for vector search, hybrid search algorithms, RAG architecture - all within the internship period.

**Proactiveness (Good):** Took initiative in researching tech stack options, proposing architecture decisions, and exploring solutions before asking for help.

**Discipline (Good):** Consistently showed up on time, followed the schedule, and met deadlines. When team meetings got rescheduled due to others' circumstances, I stayed flexible while maintaining my own commitments.

**Communication (Fair):** Got better over time, but still working on presenting technical concepts more clearly and keeping stakeholders updated proactively.

**Problem-solving (Fair):** Can debug and find solutions, but sometimes took longer than necessary. Need to develop a more systematic approach.

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Systematic problem-solving** - When stuck, follow a structured debugging approach instead of trying random things. Document the process for future reference.

2. **Proactive communication** - Don't wait until someone asks for status updates. Share progress regularly, flag blockers early.

3. **Documentation habits** - Write things down while working, not after. Good notes save time when revisiting code or explaining to others.

4. **Deep technical expertise** - Continue building depth in specific areas like security, networking, or container orchestration beyond the foundational knowledge gained.

### Looking Forward

This internship gave me a solid foundation in AWS and cloud development. The combination of structured learning (modules, labs) and practical application (team project) made the knowledge stick. 

What I'm taking away:
- Confidence to architect and deploy cloud solutions
- Experience working on a team with real deadlines
- A network of mentors and peers in the cloud community
- Clear understanding of what I need to improve

The journey doesn't stop here. There's still a lot to learn - Kubernetes, advanced networking, security certifications - but I now have the foundation to build on.
