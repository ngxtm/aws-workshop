This section shares my personal experience during the internship at First Cloud Journey (FCJ). Hopefully, this feedback helps the FCJ team continue improving the program for future interns.

### Overall Experience

#### 1. Working Environment

The office environment at FCJ is really well set up for getting work done. Clean spaces, good lighting, and a professional atmosphere that puts you in the right mindset to focus. It's not the kind of place where you feel like you're just filling a seat - there's actual energy and purpose.

What stands out most is the people. The mentors are approachable and friendly, which makes a huge difference when you're new and still figuring things out. There's no awkwardness in asking questions or admitting when you don't understand something. That kind of openness is rare and I appreciated it a lot.

#### 2. Mentor Support

This is probably where FCJ shines the brightest. The mentors are genuinely invested in helping interns learn and grow.

A few things that made the difference:
- **No question is ignored.** Whether it's something basic or more complex, the mentors always take time to explain properly.
- **They don't just give you answers.** They guide you to figure things out yourself, which helps the learning stick.
- **Available beyond office hours.** When I was stuck on something, mentors were willing to help even outside regular working time.

First and foremost, a huge thank you to **anh Hưng** - Vietnam's top AWS Solution Architect and the pioneer who founded this community. Every interaction with anh Hưng shows his professionalism and attention to detail, whether in meetings or in the work he does for the community. His vision and dedication laid the foundation for everything FCJ has become today.

Equally important, thank you to **anh Kha** - anh Hưng's mentee who has carried the torch and guided FCJ to where it is today. Anh Kha provided objective feedback, created opportunities, and built this incredible learning environment for us interns. Beyond the professional side, anh Kha is genuinely fun, warm-hearted, and always enthusiastic about helping others grow. Having leaders like anh Hưng and anh Kha makes all the difference.

Also special thanks to the two "anh Thịnh" - one is incredibly strong on the technical side (the kind of person who knows AWS inside out), and the other is super friendly and approachable (the kind who makes you feel comfortable asking anything). Having this mix of mentors around created a really supportive learning environment.

#### 3. Relevance to My Studies

The work at FCJ aligned well with what I learned at university, but also pushed me into new territory. Cloud architecture, Infrastructure as Code, serverless - these weren't things I'd deeply explored before. The internship filled those gaps.

The team project was particularly valuable. Building something real with actual users in mind (even if hypothetical) is very different from school assignments. You learn to make tradeoffs, deal with constraints, and actually ship something that works.

#### 4. Learning Opportunities

In just over 3 months, I went from basic AWS knowledge to deploying a RAG system with Terraform. That progression happened because:
- The learning path was well-structured (modules → labs → project)
- Mentors were there to unblock when I got stuck
- The events (Vietnam Cloud Day, workshops) provided exposure to real-world applications
- Working on a team project forced me to apply what I learned

Beyond technical skills, I also picked up soft skills - how to communicate in a professional setting, how to work effectively in a team, how to manage time across multiple responsibilities.

#### 5. Company Culture

FCJ has a positive culture that balances professionalism with a relaxed atmosphere. People take their work seriously but still know how to keep things light. When there's pressure (like before a project deadline), the team pulls together instead of pointing fingers.

As an intern, I never felt like I was "just an intern." I was treated as part of the team, given real responsibilities, and my input was valued. That sense of belonging made the experience much more meaningful.

#### 6. Internship Policies

The program is well-organized:
- Clear expectations and milestones
- Flexible when needed (life happens)
- Access to internal training and events
- Opportunity to work on actual projects, not just busy work

### Specific Feedback

**What I'm most satisfied with:**

Meeting new people - both fellow interns and professionals in the field. The connections I made during this internship are valuable beyond just the technical knowledge. Being able to experience working at a place connected to a major company like AWS is something I didn't take for granted. And having mentors who actually care about your growth? That's not something you find everywhere.

**What could be improved:**

One small thing: it would be nice to have a water dispenser in the intern room. Currently, if you want water, you have to go outside the building to buy it, which takes time and breaks your focus. A simple water station would make the workspace more convenient.

**Would I recommend FCJ to a friend?**

Absolutely yes. Here's why:
- You get hands-on experience with real cloud technologies
- You're actually learning, not just doing grunt work
- The mentors genuinely want to help you succeed
- The environment is professional but not stuffy
- You come out with skills that matter in the job market

If someone asks me "where should I intern to learn cloud?", FCJ is an easy recommendation.

**Will I continue with FCJ?**

Yes, I plan to stay connected with the FCJ community. The relationships and knowledge I've built here are too valuable to just walk away from. Whether it's participating in future programs, attending events, or just staying in touch with the people I've met - FCJ will remain part of my journey in cloud.

### Final Thoughts

This internship exceeded my expectations. I came in hoping to learn some AWS basics and left with actual project experience, a network of mentors and peers, and confidence to tackle cloud challenges. 

The FCJ team has built something special here - a program that combines structured learning with practical application, wrapped in a supportive environment. For anyone considering an internship in cloud computing, this is a solid choice.

Special thanks to anh Hưng for pioneering this community, anh Kha for your leadership and vision, and to all the mentors and staff at FCJ who made this experience possible. Looking forward to what comes next.
