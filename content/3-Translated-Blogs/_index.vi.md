Wiz for Government unifies visibility and security with three core modules—Wiz Cloud (continuous monitoring), Wiz Code (secure SDLC guardrails), and Wiz Defend (cloud-native detection and response). Real-world impact includes faster onboarding (e.g., Navy COSMOS cut processes from months to minutes) and stronger defense through integrations like Amazon GuardDuty and the Wiz Security Graph.
