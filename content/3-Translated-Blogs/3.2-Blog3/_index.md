Amazon Web Services (AWS) is excited to announce the cohort of 67 startups from Australia, India, and Japan selected for the [AWS Space Accelerator: APJ 2025 program](https://t-hub.co/programs/aws-space-accelerator-apj/). These startups will receive support from AWS and partner organizations to accelerate their growth and innovation in the space technology sector. The 10-week virtual program kicked off on September 19, 2025, and will run through November 28, 2025, culminating in a Demo Day where startups will showcase their solutions to space agencies, investors, AWS customers, and space industry leaders.

### Developing future leaders of space innovation

Established in 2020, the AWS Aerospace and Satellite business unit was created specifically to help the global space industry leverage cloud technologies effectively. Our experience has consistently shown that startups who build their foundations on advanced cloud technology demonstrate significantly higher success rates in scaling their innovations and securing sustainable growth.

The focus on India, Japan, and Australia for this year’s accelerator reflects the extraordinary momentum in these markets. India’s space sector has seen unprecedented growth, supported significant government investment such as the recent allocations of INR ₹5 billion (approximately USD $57 million) by the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre ([IN-SPACe](https://www.inspace.gov.in/)) to space technology innovators to help early-stage space technologies go commercial as the country seeks to boost its market share in the global space industry. Japan has demonstrated its commitment to space innovation through the establishment of a JPY ¥1 trillion (approximately USD $6.7 billion) [Space Strategic Fund](https://fund.jaxa.jp/content/uploads/Overview_of_The_SpaceStrategy_Fund.pdf), a 10-year initiative managed by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ([JAXA](https://global.jaxa.jp/)) that focuses on three key areas: satellites, space exploration, and space transportation. This fund aims to strengthen Japan’s technological capabilities and supply chain autonomy, with goals to expand the country’s domestic space industry to JPY ¥8 trillion [(approximately USD $60 billion) by the early 2030s](https://fund.jaxa.jp/content/uploads/Overview_of_The_SpaceStrategy_Fund.pdf). Meanwhile, in Australia more than [AUD $300 million](https://www.indailysa.com.au/news/business/2025/07/16/private-investment-in-australian-space-sector-hits-300m) (approximately USD $197 million) in private funds were invested in the Australian space sector in 2024 with Gilmour Space achieving its first launch attempt in July 2025—a key milestone in establishing sovereign launch capability.

With the AWS Space Accelerator program now in its fifth consecutive year, the 2025 Asia Pacific and Japan (APJ) cohort marks our largest and most ambitious accelerator to date with 67 selected startups—nearly three times the size of our 2024 cohort of 24 companies. From an impressive pool of over 150 applicants, the selection process was highly competitive, reflecting the tremendous growth of the space industry across the Asia-Pacific region.

“The space industry is experiencing unprecedented growth and innovation across APJ, with startups developing groundbreaking technologies that have the potential to transform how space organizations operate in space,” said Clint Crosier, director of the aerospace and satellite business at AWS. “Through the AWS Space Accelerator, we’re proud to support these visionary companies as they leverage cloud technologies to solve complex challenges in space and back on earth, from designing new launch systems to climate resilience, space sustainability, and data accessibility.”

The 2025 cohort will receive comprehensive support through a tailored ten-week program, including up to USD $100,000 in AWS credits as part of AWS Activate, technical guidance from AWS experts and partners to build solutions on AWS, business coaching and mentorship from experienced industry leaders, connections to venture capital firms and potential customers, and access to space industry leaders.

### Accelerating innovation in space technology

The AWS Space Accelerator: APJ 2025 program will be delivered in collaboration with AWS Partners [T-Hub](https://t-hub.co/), [Minfy](https://www.minfytech.com/), [Fusic](https://fusic.co.jp/english), and [Ansys](https://www.ansys.com/industries/space), space agencies including the [Australian Space Agency](https://www.space.gov.au/) and [IN-SPACe](https://www.inspace.gov.in/inspace), along with leading space organizations [iLaunch](https://ilaunch.space/), and [SKY Perfect JSAT Corporation](https://www.skyperfectjsat.space/jsat/en/), bringing together deep technical and business expertise along with space industry leadership to support the participating startups.

“We believe the cloud is a powerful enabler for space innovation,” added Crosier. “By providing these startups with the technology, resources, and mentorship they need, and leveraging the strengths and expertise of our collaborating organizations, we’re building a community to advance and propel space technology innovation across the region. We can’t wait to see what this new cohort will accomplish.”
